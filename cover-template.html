        Dear [Company Name],
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm writing to express my strong interest in the [Position Role] role
        at [Company Name]. With my solid technical skills, efficient communication,
        and extensive experience troubleshooting and debugging, I feel I would be
        a valuable addition to your team. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Lead Instructor at General Assembly, one of North America's top coding
        bootcamps, I was able to aquire and refine a diverse set of skills. Guiding 
        and mentoring students through the immersive curriculum helped to strengthen
        my existing leadership abilities from my time as a Project Lead, while also 
        instilling a good amount of patience and compassion. In each cohort, I found 
        myself frequently adapting our lessons as libraries or frameworks went 
        through updates, and had to come up with solutions and fixes across many 
        operating systems and languages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical expertise includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Proficiency in multiple languages such as Javascript and Python</li>
          <li>Strong knowledge of web frameworks like Express and Django</li>
          <li>Experince with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB</li>
          <li>Understanding of modern conventions like REST APIs and MVC</li>
          <li>Familiarity with in-demand tools such as Git, AWS</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel as though my skillset is particularly suited towards this position 
        for many reasons. First of all, the demand for [Quality] aligns with my 
        experience as a [Past Position].
        [This is what I need to fill in for each job]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Company Name] seems to have the type of workplace culture that I would not 
        only fit right into, but also thrive in. I find that the best part of the 
        field of Software Engineering is the pace in which it moves, and to truly
        succeed, you must be ready and willing to always be learning something
        new. I thank you for taking the time to look into my application, and
        look forward to hearing back from you. I'd love the opportunity to discuss
        the ways in which I could become a member of your already terrific
        team of developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kindest Regards,
      </p>
      <p>
