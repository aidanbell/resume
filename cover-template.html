        Dear Software Development Team,
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Aidan, and I'd love a chance to join the team at the
        number one online classifieds site in Canada as a front-end engineer. I
        am currently a Teaching Assistant at the top ranked coding bootcamp in
        Toronto, General Assembly, from which I graduated last year with perfect
        grades after a 3-month intensive software engineering program. I believe
        that my personal and professional skillsets would blend perfectly with
        both the development team and the culture that is fostered at Kijiji.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating university, I started working as a service technician
        at an HP partner company. Over the course of 5 years, I moved my way into
        a position as a Project Manager, and became an integral part of every
        contract and project that our company received. While working in that role
        I truly realized that some of the key components to working successfully
        within a team are open channels of communication, and the recognition that
        each individual is crucial to the success of the organization as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been self-learning web development for more than 15 years through
        various online courses, tutorials, and textbooks, but in 2019 I decided
        to enroll in a Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly to
        transform my passion into a career. While in the program, I learned not
        only multiple frameworks and languages, but also how to work as part of
        a team and write clean, high-quality code. The course also allowed me to
        build my knowledge of my favourite language to work in -- Javascript. I
        find that all of the quirks and oddities that make up the language can at
        times be challenging, but those challenges make way for extremely
        rewarding end results; this is attitude I impart to the current students
        as a Teaching Assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kijiji seems to have the type of workplace culture that I would not only
        fit right into, but also thrive in. I find that the best part of the field
        of Software Engineering is the pace in which it moves, and to truly
        succeed, you must be ready and willing to always be learning something
        new. I thank you for taking the time to look into my application, and
        look forward to hearing back from you. I'd love the opportunity to discuss
        the ways in which I could become a member of your already terrific
        team of developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kindest Regards,
      </p>
      <p>
        Aidan Bell
