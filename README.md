## The Resume
---
I started (where most people do) with Good old Microsoft Word. Which as we all know is a great word processor. The only problem was, every problem I encountered I thought, "how would I code this?" So of course, I did.

Aside from wanting more control over the layout of my resume, I also admittedly needed more practice with CSS. This was the perfect opportunity to dive in and see what I could learn. I have to say, by the time I finally got my resume to where I wanted it, I had become so much more familiar with CSS that everything just fit into place.
