      <h3>Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Curious and detail-oriented, I tend to approach problems with
        creativity and efficiency first, and enjoy tinkering with the latest
        technologies. My time spent studying literature and poetry has given
        me an analytical eye, the ability to break something large into easily
        digestible morsels, and a way to take those morsels and discern their
        role as a part of something bigger. I view my place in the field of
        software engineering as one in which I have room to grow, and satiate
        my desire to never stop learning.
