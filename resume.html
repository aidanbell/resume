      <h2>Me:</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Curious and detail-oriented, I tend to approach problems with
        creativity and efficiency first, and enjoy tinkering with the latest
        technologies. After studying literature and poetry, I recognized that
        my enjoyment of deconstructing and analyzing large works was mirrored
        in the world of programming. I view my place in the field of
        software engineering as one in which I have room to grow, and satiate
        my desire to never stop learning.

              This app won the Mintbean General Assembly CareerHack of May, 2020. The challenge
              was to build a clean, simple, markdown editor. I leveraged Reacts controlled inputs
              to include live updating, while also hitting almost all of the bonus challenges
              (scroll sync between input/output, download as PDF, creative design).
