      <h3>Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Curious and detail-oriented, I tend to approach problems with
        creativity and efficiency first, and enjoy tinkering with the latest
        technologies. After studying literature and poetry, I recognized that
        my enjoyment of deconstructing and analyzing large works was mirrored
        in the world of programming. I view my place in the field of
        software engineering as one in which I have room to grow, and satiate
        my desire to never stop learning.
